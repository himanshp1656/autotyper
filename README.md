# autotyper

autotyper is an application that mimics human typing with an accuracy of 80%. It allows users to simulate typing with optional delays and introduces errors with a specified probability. The application is built with Python and Tkinter, providing an easy-to-use graphical user interface for typing simulation.

## Features:

- Simulates typing with optional delay before starting to type.
- Allows introducing errors with a specified probability (e.g., mistyped characters).
- Supports custom input text to type.
- Adjustable delay options for typing start time.
- User-friendly graphical interface built with Tkinter.

## How to Use:

[Watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJkFHR3g8eQ)

1. Enter the text you want to type in the provided text input area.
2. Choose the delay time using the radio buttons. This delay indicates the time to put the cursor before starting to type.
3. Click on the "Start Typing" button to begin the typing simulation.
4. The application will simulate typing the entered text with the specified delay before starting to type.
5. You can switch to other applications during the delay and position the cursor where you want the typing to begin.

## Note:

- The application requires Python and the PyAutoGUI library to run. 
- To run the application, execute the provided executable file (for Windows) or run the Python script if you have Python installed.

## Usage with Code:

- To use the code, run the `autotyper.py` file after installing the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install tk
    pip install pyautogui
    ```
